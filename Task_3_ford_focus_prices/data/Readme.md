# Origin of data

The data of used Ford Focus Hatchbacks was scraped from the largest Hungarian used car website, hasznaltauto.hu on 2020.10.13 15:32 for education and research purposes as part of a University course term project. 

For the data collection I used a publicly available point and click interface web scraper which can be added as an extension to Google Chrome at the following website (<https://webscraper.io/>). 

The raw, scraped data can be found in the raw folder. 
In the clean folder the filtered and cleaned dataset can be found ready for analysis.

The Variables.xlsx contains the variables description of the cleaned dataset.
